NAME
     instatweet -- tweet images from an instagram account

SYNOPSIS
     instatweet [-dhv] [-T tumblr] -f seen -i instagram -t twitter

DESCRIPTION
     instatweet will fetch the latest image from the given instagram account
     and post it on Twitter.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported by instatweet:

     -T tumblr	   Fetch images from this tumblr blog.

     -d		   Don't do anything, just show what would be done.

     -f seen	   Log the pictures to the file 'seen'; only tweet pictures
		   not in that file.

     -h		   Display help and exit.

     -i instagram  Fetch the latest image from this instagram account.

     -t twitter	   Post the image to this twitter account.

     -v		   Be verbose.	Can be specified multiple times.

DETAILS
     Posting Instagram pictures to Twitter is a bit of a pain, since instagram
     links do not get a Twitter image card, requiring the user to follow the
     link.

     instatweet allows you to periodically poll an instagram account and have
     it post new images to a Twitter account.  That way, you can follow an
     instagram account without having to have or use an instagram account and
     without having to follow individual links.

     If the -f flag is given, then instatweet will log the picture ID in the
     given file and only tweet images that are not included in that file.

     instatweet uses the tweet(1) command-line utility to post the picture.
     This requires you to have set up tweet(1) for the given account prior to
     using instatweet.

EXIT STATUS
     The instatweet utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
