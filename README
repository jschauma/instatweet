Summary
-------
Posting Instagram pictures to Twitter is a bit of a
pain, since instagram links do not get a Twitter image
card, requiring the user to follow the link.

'instatweet' allows you to periodically poll an
instagram account and have it post new images to a
Twitter account.  That way, you can follow an
instagram account without having to have or use an
instagram account and without having to follow
individual links.

Since Instagram may require you to have a developer
API account with Facebook and kick you back to a login
screen, 'instatweet' will fall back to using
picuki.net to grab the image.

'instatweet' also supports pulling an image from
Tumblr posts.

If the -f flag is given, then 'instatweet' will log
the picture ID in the given file and only tweet images
that are not included in that file.

'instatweet' uses the tweet(1) command-line utility to
post the picture.  This requires you to have set up
tweet(1) for the given account prior to using
'instatweet'.

Please see the manual page for details.
